    """Search the knowledge corpus for content relevant to a query.

    Use this to look up information from the project's knowledge base —
    internal docs, past decisions, incident writeups, runbooks. The tool
    performs semantic search: it finds chunks whose meaning is close to
    the query, not just literal keyword matches.

    Use recall when:
    - The user asks about internal/private content the model wouldn't
      know from training (specific projects, teams, past decisions,
      internal jargon)
    - You need context from a large corpus that wouldn't fit in AGENTS.md
    - The question is semantic — "what did we decide about X" rather
      than a specific file lookup

    Do NOT use recall for:
    - Session memory: that's AGENTS.md, already in your context
    - Public knowledge you reliably know from training
    - Current-events lookups: use web_search instead
    - Direct file reads: if you know the exact file, use read()
    - Content from previous tool calls in this session: previous 
      web_search results, previous read outputs, previous bash outputs.
      Those live either in your context (head/tail) or in offloaded files
      inside the workspace at .tool_outputs/, referenced by [TRUNCATED...]
      markers. Use read() on the marker's path; recall() only searches
      the project knowledge corpus.

    Args:
        query: A specific, focused query. Natural phrasing works best.
        max_results: How many chunks to return. Defaults to the config
            default (typically 5). Lower for narrow lookups, higher when
            you want broader context.

    Returns:
        Formatted text with numbered results, each showing the source
        path and the retrieved chunk.
